#Tsutomu Nakajima's Portfolio Hello, I'm Tsutomu Nakajima, a Python developer. This is my portfolio, where you can find the programs I've developed.

##Programs Here are the programs that I have developed so far:

###Calculator A simple calculator that performs basic mathematical operations. It takes user input and returns the result of the operation. The calculator currently supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

###Random password generator Generates a random password with the desired length and strength. It allows users to customize the length and complexity of the generated password. Users can choose from a variety of options, including the length of the password, the inclusion of numbers or special characters, and the overall strength of the password.

###Count down timer A program that takes a specified amount of time and counts down to zero, notifying the user when the time has elapsed. The timer is useful for timing activities such as exercise or cooking, and can be customized to suit the user's needs.

###Tic-Tac-Toe A classic game of tic-tac-toe where two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The game is designed to be played on the command line and supports two-player mode.

###Reversi A strategy board game for two players. Currently, it is a two-player game, but I plan to implement an AI in the future. The game is played on an 8x8 board with pieces that are black on one side and white on the other. Players take turns placing pieces on the board with the goal of flipping their opponent's pieces to their own color.

###Uno A card game where players take turns playing cards from their hand, matching the color or value of the previously played card. The game supports multiple players and can be played on the command line.

##Technologies Used All of the programs in my portfolio are developed in Python. I have used various Python libraries such as random and time to implement the functionality of these programs.
